# WearWatchfaces 2.0 - rewrite

## TODO:

- [ ] use good practises for android libraries -  https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library
- [ ] allow overriding style defaults per watchface (for example when customization is disabled)
- [ ] add priority to WatchFaceFeature-s to order them consistently in the on watch editor
- [ ] make all ic_launcher resources specify `adaptive` icon
- [ ] make jimball play [Funkytown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6dqIYKIBSU) (maybe even configurable: **never**, **on_touch**, **always**)
- [ ] add jimball gif sources (pixelorama project) and figure out how to manage original sources for WFF based watchfaces
